# Fish-Classification-ANN
# Fish Species Classification with Deep Learning

This project focuses on classifying fish species using deep learning models based on the [A Large-Scale Fish Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crowww/a-large-scale-fish-dataset) from Kaggle. The main goal is to accurately classify fish species from the provided dataset, applying image processing techniques and training a neural network model.

## Introduction

The aim of this project is to develop a deep learning model that can classify various species of fish based on their images. The dataset contains fish images categorized into different species, and our model leverages these images to learn the distinguishing features of each species.

We followed several key steps including data exploration, preprocessing, model design, training, and evaluation. This project is ideal for students or practitioners looking to strengthen their understanding of image classification and deep learning.
